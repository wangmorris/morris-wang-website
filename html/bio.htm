    <th colspan="4" scope="row"><p align="left">As a young child, I had been fond of drawing and crafts. Growing up in the city flourished with ceramic art, I felt for the 3-dimensional sculpting. Since I was 16 year old, I went to ceramic factories during every summer break to learn ceramic art. I studied graphic design in high school, and chose sculpture as my major in college ( National Taiwan Art Academy ). I endeavored in the understanding of human anatomy for arts, and got several prizes in sculpture competitions during the college years.</p>
      <p align="left">Two years after the graduation, I went aboard for higher art education at the School of Visual Arts in New York . A year later, finding that the computer animation was quite visually impressive. I decided to transfer my study computer arts in the master program at the New York Institution of Technology. </p>
      <p align="left">Once I graduated, Rhythm and Hues Studio, Inc., winner of the 1996 Oscar best visual effect, employed me as a technical director. For nine years, the job I do include clay sculpting, digital sculpting e-sculpture, modeling, mapping, facial and muscle expressions¡Ketc. Since then, I had involved in the visual effects part of more than 20 movies. In 2001, I was granted the U.S. permanent resident as the extraordinary talented. </p>
